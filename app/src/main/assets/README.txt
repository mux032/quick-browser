This directory will contain the summarization_model.tflite file.

The model should be a TensorFlow Lite model optimized for text summarization,
with a size less than 100MB as per requirements.

Recommended models to consider:
1. MobileBERT or TinyBERT for extractive summarization
2. DistilBART for abstractive summarization
3. BART-mini for abstractive summarization

The model should be downloaded during app installation or on first use.
